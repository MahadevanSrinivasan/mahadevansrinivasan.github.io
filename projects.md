- #### [Shut up and cast]({% post_url 2015-10-18-announcing-shutupandcast %})
Thanks for the 4000 odd users of my previous chrome plugin Stream to XBMC, I decided to extend the pluginâ€™s capability to be used with the most popular casting device and the one which started it all, Chromecast. If you have a Chromecast and want to watch videos from sites for which there is no Chromecast app, you have come to the right place. Take it for a spin.
