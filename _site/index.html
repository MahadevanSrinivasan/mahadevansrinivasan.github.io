        </h3>
        <p>Another interesting algorithm I ran into recently is for a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. Imagine a caching system that stores key-value pairs. And you have room for only a limited number of key-value pairs. So, when the capacity is exceeded, we need to remove the least recently used (used means accessed) key-value pair. This can be simply implemented using a linked list to keep track of which key was accessed least recently. Whenever a key is read / written, we can just move the corresponding linked list node to the head of the list. And when the capacity is exceeded, simply delete the last key in the linked list and remove that key-value pair from the hash table. Hash table look up is O(1). So is removing a node and adding it to the head of the list. But, what about figuring out where the key is in the linked list itself so we can move it?</p>

        </h3>
        <p>I recently ran into this interesting problem called “Word Break” - quite a popular interview question. If you want to practice solving this problem, head over to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/">leetcode</a>. First variant of this problem is quite simple. Given a string, check if it can be split into words to form a full sentence. You are also given a dictionary to check if the word is valid or not. For example, given a string “thisisatest” and a dictionary (list of words) - “this”, “is”, “a”, “test”, your function should return true. For the same dictionary, “thisisnotatest” should return false.</p>

        <p>For one of my side projects, I had to solve an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">Integer Programming</a> problem. I was initially contemplating on using some existing MATLAB/Octave package to the job. The first  option that was available was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic Algorithm</a> module in MATLAB. It turned out to be too random and not methodical at all. This is not surprising as genetic algorithm is in essence a random algorithm and does not suit all kinds of problems. It could work for <a href="">some problems</a>. Next option was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">Simulated Annealing</a>. Even for this, there was a package in MATLAB. It worked ok but the convergence was too slow for my needs. So, I ended up writing my own custom gradient descent algorithm to solve this problem using Python. In this article, I am going the detail the algorithm and the design choices.</p>

One of the first projects we did on the Coursera ML course is Digit Recognition. There is a well known digit dataset called MNIST. For the course though, we used a small subset of the dataset. We have a set of scanned images which contain numbers and we have to design a model to correctly classify them. Before we look into the full classification, it makes sense to start with something simpler. How about just classifying the 0s and the 1s?</p>

One of the tasks is to install the latest linux kernel on your machine. You have an option of doing it in a Virtual box setting. Hey, but where is the fun in doing that? I had a Raspberry Pi handy and found a couple of good Wiki pages on how to compile your own kernel for Raspberry Pi (<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Upstream_Kernel_Compilation">here</a> and <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation">here</a>). These two pages have the all the info needed but it is kind of scattered.
Fastest way to compile the kernel is to do in in Ubuntu (You could technically do it on a MAC, but it is slightly more involved). I tried on my MAC first but ended up installing Ubuntu through Virtualbox to do the compilation. Here are the steps:</p>
