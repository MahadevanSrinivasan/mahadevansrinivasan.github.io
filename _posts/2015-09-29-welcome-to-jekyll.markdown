As part of my *learn something new everyday*, I am migrating all my ramblings to a Jekyll-based blog. It is simple, easy to maintain and super customizable.  With this change, I am hoping to write more often.

Some of the great features of Jekyll I am thrilled about:

- Jekyll offers powerful support for displaying code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def main(name):
  print "Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

- Auto generated blog index
The content in my home page is auto-generated if you can believe it.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
